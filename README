 BitFlux
 
More than just a pretty TorrentFlux rewrite.

Specification:

 - Protocol agnostic: Supports BitTorrent, FTP, SFTP, HTTP... If you can control it from PHP, BitFlux can support it.
 - Database agnostic: Supports many modern DBs through the Doctrine ORM.
 - Pretty: Allows extensive theming through the Twig templating engine.
 - Speaks your language, too: Designed from the ground up to offer good internationalisation.
 - Extensible: Write your own plug-ins and tie them into the workflow.
